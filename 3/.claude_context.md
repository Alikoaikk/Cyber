# Claude Context - Tor Hidden Service Project

## Project Overview
Student is learning to build a Tor hidden service with Nginx using Docker (not VM).

## Requirements (from subject)
- Web server showing webpage on Tor network (.onion address)
- Static webpage: single index.html file
- Nginx as web server (no other server/framework)
- HTTP access on port 80
- SSH access on port 4242
- No firewall rules or port opening needed
- Using Docker for implementation

## Files Required
1. index.html ✓ (already exists)
2. nginx.conf (to create)
3. sshd_config (to create)
4. torrc (to create)
5. Dockerfile (needed but not in submission list)
6. docker-compose.yml (optional, for easier deployment)

## Student's Background
- Does NOT know how Tor works
- Has NEVER used Docker before
- Wants to LEARN step-by-step, not just have it done
- Needs teaching approach, not just solutions

## Teaching Progress
✓ Explained the complete flow: User → Tor Network → Tor Service → Nginx → index.html
✓ Explained each component (Docker, Nginx, Tor, SSH)
✓ Showed visual diagrams of architecture
✓ Student understands the big picture

## Next Steps (Teaching Plan)
1. Create nginx.conf (simplest - web server config)
   - Explain each directive line by line
   - Teach HTTP server basics

2. Create torrc (Tor configuration)
   - Explain hidden service concept
   - Teach HiddenServiceDir and HiddenServicePort

3. Create sshd_config (SSH server config)
   - Explain SSH security settings
   - Teach port configuration

4. Create Dockerfile
   - Teach Docker basics (FROM, RUN, COPY, EXPOSE, CMD)
   - Explain multi-service container setup
   - Show how to install packages in Debian/Ubuntu base

5. Create docker-compose.yml (optional but recommended)
   - Simplifies running the container
   - Teaches Docker Compose basics

6. Create startup script
   - Needed to run multiple services (nginx, tor, sshd) in one container
   - Teach process management

7. Build and test
   - docker build
   - docker run with port mapping
   - Test .onion access
   - Test SSH access

## Important Notes
- Student wants explanations, not just code dumps
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Use simple analogies
- Check understanding before moving forward
- Let student create files themselves with guidance
