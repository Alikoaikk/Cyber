# Tor Configuration for Hidden Service
# This creates your .onion address and routes traffic

## Hidden Service Configuration ##

# Where to store the hidden service data
# This directory will contain:
# - hostname file (your .onion address)
# - private_key (KEEP THIS SECRET!)
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/

# Port mapping: .onion:80 -> localhost:80 (nginx)
# When someone visits your .onion address on port 80,
# Tor will forward the request to localhost:80 (where Nginx is listening)
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80


## General Tor Settings ##

# Run Tor as this user (security)
User tor

# Where to store Tor data
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor

# Logging level (notice = normal, info = verbose, debug = very verbose)
Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log

# Control port (for managing Tor - optional)
# ControlPort 9051

# Enable hidden service statistics (optional - for monitoring)
# HiddenServiceStatistics 1


## Security Settings ##

# Prevent Tor from running as root
# This is a safety feature
RunAsDaemon 1

# Circuit build timeout (how long to wait for Tor connection)
CircuitBuildTimeout 60

# Number of introduction points (how many entry points to your service)
# More = better availability, but slightly slower
# HiddenServiceNumIntroductionPoints 3


## Optional: Multiple Ports ##
# If you want to run HTTPS later, uncomment this:
# HiddenServicePort 443 127.0.0.1:443


## Optional: Hidden Service Version ##
# By default uses v3 .onion addresses (recommended)
# v3 addresses are 56 characters long (more secure than v2)
# No configuration needed - v3 is automatic
